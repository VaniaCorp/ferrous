      content: `Over 350 million adults in Africa alone remain unbanked, facing systemic challenges that include limited access to traditional banking services, high transaction costs, and outdated financial infrastructures that fail to meet the needs of emerging economies.

By leveraging the widespread adoption of mobile money and combining it with the intelligence of advanced AI, Ferrous breaks through the walls that have kept millions excluded from global financial opportunities. Users can now deposit local currency through familiar mobile channels without needing international cards, complex KYC processes, or facing the friction of traditional banking systems.

Once inside, AI does the heavy liftingâ€”guiding users with personalized investment strategies, managing risk, and handling all the technical complexity of the financial system in the background. This creates a seamless experience where users can focus on their financial goals while the platform handles the complexities of global finance.`
